this chapter we building objects. so this script is all about understanding how the objects work and how to target it's nested values.
we will use string concatenation to get the value;
Concatenation, in the context of programming, is the operation of joining two strings together. The term"concatenation" literally means to merge two things together.
and also string interpolation
 An interpolated string is a string literal that might contain interpolated expressions.
so let's build some cakes.




also we are doing some lightning array and object exercises, we used nested objects and arrays and then console.loged the value.
